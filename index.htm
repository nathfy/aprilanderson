				<i>"This music is fresh, intriguing and beguiling; a new direction the acoustic scene has been waiting for"</i>
				<br /><b>BBC PRODUCER - DAVID P CRICKMORE</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				April Anderson is a multi instrumentalist and an original singer-songwriter. 
				Her debut album "Swings and Roundabouts" has just been released on Acoustic Clock Records. 
				Her music has been described as a unique blend of contemporary folk, tinged with jazz 
				and she has been compared to early Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush, John Martyn and Nick Drake. 
				Her lyrics often tell stories that are veiled in quirkiness and ambiguity, with themes 
				centering on life's trials and traumas, joys and disappointments. All are delivered 
				with an undercurrent of meaningful social comment.
			</p>
			<p>
				As well as singing, April plays all guitars, mandolin, flute and piano on the album and 
				is the sole writer, arranger and producer. Her guitar style reflects her interest in 
				non-conventional tuning and finger picking while the vocal harmonies are sumptuous, 
				sometimes ethereal. At times they possess a distinctive dissonant, edgy quality to 
				them which is echoed in her arrangements.
			</p>
			<p>
				With tremendous playing from her backing band, featuring an array of instruments such 
				as Hammer Dulcimer, Recorders, Cello, exotic percussion, and some truly inspirational 
				fiddle playing from Gerry Diver (producer of Lisa Knapp's album Wild and Undaunted) 
				"Swings and Roundabouts" is an exciting and moving experience.

				Musical History
			</h2>
			<p>
				Taking the conventional route, April trained as a classical singer, pianist and flautist; 
				she then undertook a degree in Jazz Contemporary and Popular music at The City of Leeds 
				College of Music and graduated with a First.
			</p>
			<p>
				After college April expanded her work as a jobbing musician travelling the world singing 
				and playing piano. Her keyboard, flute and guitar work has been in demand for a variety 
				of bands, and as soloist she has performed at many venues and festivals all over the 
				country. She has worked as a studio session player for the <b>BBC</b> and <b>Yorkshire TV, Ecco, 
				Chrysalis</b> and <b>Arista Records</b>, composed incidental music for a couple of touring theatre 
				shows and, most recently, contributed flute to <b>Curfew's</b> latest album "Inside" and <b>Roger 
				Francomb's CD</b> "Easy Storm". As a piano vocalist and a singer-actress April has performed 
				in the <b>West End</b> at the <b>London Palladium</b> and the <b>Royal Albert Hall</b> and 
				appeared in an <b>award winning Off-Broadway show</b>.

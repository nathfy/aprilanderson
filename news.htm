					April starts to record her second album "Little Red Flags"
					</strong>
					<br />
					Recording has now started for April's second album, working title "Little Red Flags" She is planning to donate a large percentage of all the album sales to Cancer research and a Huntington’s disease charity. Although April's music is still a delightful fusion of folk, blues and jazz, this album is definitely more in the folk camp this time, with some traditional numbers and some brand new hornpipes and jigs.
					<br />
					<br />
					All the material is inspired by the wonderful local folk tales and stunning countryside encountered on her daily walks around the Somerset levels, the Quantocks, and the amazing Devon and Dorset coastlines. Of course it wouldn’t be an album by April Anderson if there wasn’t a healthy balance of some personal songs full of introspection and some soul searching, as well as some gut wrenching soulful blues. There is a fantastic line up of musicians ready and waiting for the red light, some of whom I am sure you will know! 
					<br />
					<br />
					Watch this space... for clips!
